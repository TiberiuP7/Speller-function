# Speller-function

For this I used data structures such as nodes to store different words from a given dictionary to another dictionary, while checking each word at the same time for having spelling errors. I also used functions like malloc to tell the computer to allocate memory for a certain node.
It checks if the words that are given as input from the user are in the dictionary file and if they are, check for spelling errors.
